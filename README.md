# This is an auto build of the MLKit Samples since Google dev relations didn't create a build action on this here service

Github actions builds the APK for us but it's buried deep below in a build artifact which you can find under the "Actions" button that is probably somewhere above this text. There is also a limitation in the GitHub UI that always stuffs single file artifacts into ZIP files. So you'll have to unzip it after you download and then go through the unknown sources dance on your phone. It works, you'll figure it out.

# MLKit Samples

A collection of quickstart samples demonstrating the [ML Kit](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit) APIs on Android and iOS.

Note: due to how this repo works, we no longer accept pull requests directly. Instead, we'll patch them internally and then sync them out.
